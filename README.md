We here at Peek are big fans of GraphQL.
#### Orders

It might also be nice to allow clients to request the list of payments that have been applied to an order, so let's
include that too.

### API Expectations & Extras

At a minimum, we ask the above be implemented, and at least 2 of the following extra expectations that your API will provide:

* Explore subscriptions
  * Implement a basic subscription so a client can be notified anytime an order is placed or a payment is made.

# Payload

Please import the file **peek.json** in insomnia
